We have a small Ultrastar based singing community and we would like to improve game experience.
Singing with Ultrastar and Vocaluxe is not a network game. People playing it at home with their friends.
But what if, we can play with our online friends? It would be very good :)

To do this first we need to standardize songs. Every player must have same version. 
This could be solved with a community website. 
Secondly, we need that Vocaluxe is able to communicate with the community's database ...

=================================
= Features (currently)			=
=================================
- Can send scores to a community website (with authentication)
- Can load highscores from website (without authentication)
* New party mode: Community Contest (under development)


=================================
= How to test				    =
=================================
- Upload Community/php-sample/index.php to a webserver
- Create VocaluxePath/Community/Profiles folder and copy sample.xml here (This is a Community profile file for user authentication)
- Setup community server in Config.xml 

  Sample config:
  <root>
	....
	<Community>
		<Active>TR_CONFIG_ON</Active>
		<Server>http://your.server.org/php-sample/index.php</Server>
		<Name>Sample Community</Name>
		<AutosendScores>TR_CONFIG_OFF</AutosendScores> 
		<AuthProfile>sample.xml</AuthProfile> 
	</Community>
  </root>	

- Start Vocaluxe
- Go to Profiles and set a Community Profile to your Singing profile
- Start singing in normal mode. 
- If you finished the song, on score screen your points will be sent to server.
- On highscores screen press [Space]. Vocaluxe will load some random stats.


This is first primitive version, i'm working to improve.
